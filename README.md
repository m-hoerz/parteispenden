CSVs of the donations received by the main German parties

This is a very machine readable version of the donations the parties in the German Bundestag received in 2011.

As the different parties provided the data in diverging formats, I've spent some time on separating the bulk "Name, Address, Postcode, City" block into separate rows. They all contain "Name, Vorname / Firma" / "Adresse" / "PLZ" / "Ort" / "Betrag (EUR)". (The Green Party also provided first and last name in seperate rows, I've kept that, but didn't go through separating this for the other parties as well.)

The source PDF -- with all the tables included as non-searchable images -- can be found at http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/123/1712340.pdf, the basic URL for the PDFs is http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/parteienfinanzierung/rechenschaftsberichte/index.html
