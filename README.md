parteispenden
=============

CSV of the donations received by the main German parties

This is a very machine readable version of the donations the parties in the German Bundestag received in 2011.

As the different parties provided the data in diverging formats, I've spent some time on separating the bulk "Name, Address, Postcode, City" block into separate rows. A single CSV for all parties contains the columns "Partei", "Name, Vorname / Firma" / "Adresse" / "PLZ" / "Ort" / "Betrag (EUR)". 

The file is separated with semicolons and encoded in UTF-8.

The source PDF -- with all the tables included as non-searchable images -- can be found at http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/123/1712340.pdf, the basic URL for the PDFs is http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/parteienfinanzierung/rechenschaftsberichte/index.html
